# NoRefreshScroll
A mod that keeps the scroll bar in the Multiplayer menu in the same position when clicking the "Refresh" button.

Basically, that's it, nothing too special. It's mainly my experiment with Mixin but I also find it handy because I regularly have to check the connection of a lot of servers, and the rate at which Minecraft drags me back up to the top of the multiplayer screen makes me want to lose my mind.
